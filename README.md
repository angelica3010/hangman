#Hangman

##Overview:

Traditionally Hangman is played with a piece of paper and pen, where one player thinks of a word, and the other player(s) try to guess the word by suggesting letters. This web app eliminates the necessity of needing paper and multiple players. By simply hitting a key on the keyboard, individual(s) can easily play in the browser! The browser randomizes a word on the back end from a word list, and keeps track of wrong guesses, guesses left, wins, and losses. Thus, when users play this game instead of gathering materials and having to find another player, they can simply play this game in their browser, making it less stress free.
