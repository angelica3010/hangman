#Hangman

##Overview:

Traditionally Hangman is played with a piece of paper and pen, where one player thinks of a word, and the other player(s) try to guess the word by suggesting letters. This web app eliminates the necessity of papers, pens, and multiple players. By simply hitting a key on the keyboard, individual(s) can easily play in the browser! The browser randomizes a word on the back end from a word list, and keeps track of wrong guesses, guesses left, wins, and losses. Thus, when users play this game they have more time to play the game vs gathering materials, keeping track of the game, and having to find another colleague to play the game.
